            What is Twiftify?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Twiftify is a fully decentralized platform that allows you to link
            your NFTs with your X (formerly Twitter) profile. It uses blockchain
            technology and smart contracts to ensure secure, authentic, and
            tamper-proof connections.

            Is it on mainnet or devnet?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            The smart contract right now is on devnet. But you can link your
            mainnet NFTs with it to test it out.

            How does Twiftify work?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Twiftify uses a custom smart program on the blockchain to link your
            NFTs to your X profile. Once linked, your NFTs can display your X
            profile URL, allowing you to share them with your audience easily
            and securely.

            Is Twiftify centralized?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            No, Twiftify is entirely decentralized. All operations, including
            NFT linking, are handled through blockchain-based smart contracts,
            ensuring full transparency and user control.

            Do I need a wallet to use Twiftify?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Yes, you need a solana wallet to interact with Twiftify. This wallet
            will be used to sign transactions and link your NFTs to your X
            profile securely.

            Are there any fees for using Twiftify?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            There might be minimal blockchain gas fees associated with the smart
            contract interactions, but Twiftify itself does not charge any
            additional platform fees.

          <AccordionContent>
            The smart contract powering Twiftify is fully auditable, and parts
            of the platform are open source, ensuring transparency and trust.
